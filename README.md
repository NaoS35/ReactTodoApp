# React ToDo App Tutorial
This is my second front-end project, where I learned how to build a to-do list app using React by following a tutorial.
To make it my own, I added a feature - a button to clear all tasks at once.

## Demo
[Live Demo](https://naos35.github.io/ReactTodoApp/).

## Technologies Used
- JavaScript
- HTML
- CSS
- React

## Based on Tutorial
This project was based on a tutorial from [Ope Afolabi](https://youtu.be/LoYbN6qoQHA?si=vOEyCsFkzKDCcCi_).

## Things I Focused on While Working on This Project.
Since this was my first time working with React, I focused on learning its structure and core concepts through hands-on practice and building it myself.

## Future Plans
- Give the UI a cuter and more original design.
- Add individual checkboxes to mark tasks as complete.
- Apply a strikethrough effect to completed tasks.
